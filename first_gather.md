help them setup.




## Gathering

About 15 people showed up;

### Venue

In our company, although the site is a bit small but from the school is very convenient.

When people had arrived and settled down a bit, we explained what we had come to do:

From that point on we mentors just wandered around between the tables, and answered any questions.



The meeting lasted from 13:30 till 16:00, since the building closes at 17:00.

### Attention and Mentors

1:4 is the ratio of teachers and students
Concentration was high all the time: at no point did we need to request silence.


### Next Event

People are already asking for the next gathering. We mentors have agreed
to do it again in a couple of weeks, to allow for some hype to build up.
